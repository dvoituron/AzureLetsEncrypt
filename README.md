# AzureLetsEncrypt
Simple tool to add a Let's Encrypt SSL certificate to your websites.
This application is a .NET Core tool that generates an SSL certificate, validates it with [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) and publishes it on an [Azure Web App](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/web/).

The detailled steps to create a SSL certificate and validate it with the Letâ€™s Encrypt Certificate Authority are described in my blog : https://dvoituron.com/2018/01/29/ssl-certification-azure-letsencrypt.
This tool automates these steps.

# How to use **AzureLetsEncrypt** ?

## Generate a certificate manually

Use the NuGet .NET Tool: [https://www.nuget.org/packages/Dvoituron.Tools.AzureLetsEncrypt](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Dvoituron.Tools.AzureLetsEncrypt)
The procedure steps are [here](src/Readme-tool.md).

## Publish automatically to Azure

1. Download the last release of [AzureLetsEncrypt](https://github.com/dvoituron/AzureLetsEncrypt/releases)
2. Edit the **AppSettings.json** file with your personnal information:
    ```json
    {
        "azure": {
            "clientId": "[clientId]",
            "clientSecret": "[clientSecret]",
            "tenantId": "[tenantId]",
            "webAppResourceId": "[ResourceID]",
            "resourceGroup": "[ResourceGroup]"
        },
        "certificate": {
            "domains": [
                "mydomain.com",
                "www.mydomain.com"
            ],
            "password": "MyP@ssword",
        }
    }
    ```

    - **clientId, clientSecret, tenantId**: 
      To get these Ids, open a `Cloud shell` in Azure portal and run this command 
      ```
      az ad sp create-for-rbac --sdk-auth
      ```
      You can also install Azure CLI on your PC, and execute `az login` and  `az ad sp create-for-rbac --sdk-auth`.  

    - **resourceId, resourceGroup**: in Azure portal, go to App Services > [Web App] > Properties > Resource ID and Resource Group.

    - **domains**: write all domains to include in the Pfx certificate. Your domains must be accessible (ex. http://mydomain.com must return a web content).

    - **password**: define a secret password to protect the generated Pfx. Keep in mind this password to install the pfx file later.

3. Save and include the new **AppSettings.json** file in the release ZIP package.
4. Go to Azure portal, navigate to your Web App Service, and select the **WebJobs** section.
   - Add a **new WebJob**
   - Define a **job name** (ex. RenewSsl)
   - Select your **local ZIP file** name, adapted with your AppSettings.json
   - Define the job type as **Triggered**
     - Trigger type : **Scheduled**
     - **CRON** Expression: `0 0 3 1 * *` Each first day of month, at 3AM
   - Save this new Job. You can Run this job for the first time to validate it. Go to the SSL settings section to check you new SSL certificate.
